# Making life easier

  These are merely a set of common Scripts used throughout several hardware
  interfaces or custom software properties put togethere alongside a single
  repository in order to make my life a little easier.

  Most of the scripts within this repo are commonly found in the internet and have
  either been: completely modified by my own set of preferences OR
  they've been shamelessly copied from someone else.

  Likewise, whenever i do shamelessly copy someone's work, i'll do my best to
  both reference and thank the original contributor/creator.

  A word of warning though:
  These preferences are biased and mostly based on my personal preferences and
  inclinations. Please, do not merely run these files if you've somehow managed
  to stumble accross this repo and don't really understand whichever or whatever
  you're trying to achieve. These are personal preferences and are only hosted in a
  public repository due to necessity.

  I mess around with a lot of shit; -- which, in essence means that I do make a lot of
  mistakes too. In essence, if you're here by accident; try to exercise some sort of
  good and/or better judgement.
  There might be irreparable damage made to your devices and i'm not liable to any
  of your personal choices.
